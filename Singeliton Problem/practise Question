## Singleton Pattern Questions:

    1) Database Connection Pool:
    A web application requires a single instance of a database connection to ensure efficient resource management. Implement the Singleton Pattern to maintain a single connection pool.

    2) Logging System:
    A software application logs errors, warnings, and debug information. Implement a Singleton-based Logger class that ensures all logs are stored in a single log file.

    3) Cache Management System:
    A web service uses a cache to store frequently accessed data. Implement a Singleton Pattern to maintain a single instance of a cache manager.

    4) Printer Spooler System:
    In a networked environment, multiple users send print requests. Implement a Singleton-based Print Spooler that queues print jobs and processes them one by one.

    5) Game Score Tracker:
    A multiplayer online game requires a global scoreboard to track the highest scores. Implement a Singleton-based ScoreTracker to manage and update scores.
